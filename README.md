## 🧾 About the Project

The **Faculty Appraisal System** is a web-based application designed to automate and optimize the appraisal workflow in educational institutions. It allows faculty members to submit their academic performance data — including teaching, research, service, and awards — and enables administrators to view, assess, and provide feedback from a centralized dashboard.

This system eliminates manual paperwork, reduces administrative workload, ensures structured data collection, and provides easy access to historical appraisal records.
